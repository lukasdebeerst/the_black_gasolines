              It was the summer of July 2016 when a 16 year old Lukas Debeerst started his search for band members. 
              As a result, he came upon a 16 year old grunge drummer Henri and 17 year old female jazz vocalist Audrey,
               who he both found via an online platform at the time.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Later that month they found and invited Bradley Remorie, who was supposed to be the rhythm guitarist 
              at the time to join the group. Again, he found him through an online platform, what they later referred 
              to as a ‘Tinder for musicians’ website.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Starting with covers from artists such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton, 
              the band soon started writing their own repertoire.

            <p className="mb-4">
              After the first rehearsal on the 28th of August, it was clear the band positions needed to change for the better, 
              as Bradley Remorie was taking the main role as the vocalist and song composer for him and Lukas Debeerst being a 
              more experienced guitarist. They switched instruments and sticked with it ever since.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Until this day no one is sure where the name ‘The Black Gasolines’ comes from. The band itself explains it as: 
              “It's just a word, like ‘shoe’. We needed a name that stood out in comparison to the other bands both online and 
              offline. So, we decided The Black Gasolines sounded good. The name has also room for people's own interpretation. 
              Just as our music does.” Later, female vocalist Audrey decided to leave the band to concentrate on other things. 
              She was followed by drummer Henri who left the band before their second concert in December later that year.

            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              In the search for a new drummer, they found Siebert D., who fell in at the time. That same year they won 
              the preliminaries of Kunstbende, a competition for artists from all over Belgium. 
              Followed by recording the band’s first EP ‘Dopamine Rush’ that was released on April 26, 2018.

            <p className="mb-4">
              In the summer of 2018, the band accidentally encountered drummer Justin Bruggeman, who was convinced to 
              have seen and talked to Bradley Remorie on a night out in the city of Leuven. Leading to a random but 
              pleasant conversation between Bruggeman and Remorie.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Finding out it was all a misunderstanding, and the band discovering Justin being a drummer, a match was born. 
              Justin joined the group soon after the band decided to get a new drummer who fitted better with their style.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              They started rehearsing right away, meeting together multiple times a week. It quickly resulted in a brand new setlist, 
              with new songs. Experimenting with new styles as alternative and psychedelic rock they released the singles 
              “Long Way Suicide” (2019) and “Kangaroo Days” (2020). Leading to 45 concerts each year. Under which being the support 
              act of other Belgian bands such as The Sore Losers and Intergalactic Lovers.

              In company of their personal photographer, the trio decided to travel overseas for their seven-day 
              ‘Dopamine Rush’ London tour in January 2019, which was well received by the public and venue owners. 
              They made stops in places like The Birds Nest, Amersham Arms, The Luna - The home of live music and 
              The Fiddlers' Elbow. This turned out as a great experience for the band.

              Entering the new year of 2020 and the upcoming Covid-19 pandemic, the group decided to use their time to
              finally start on their debut album, which would become a full concept album.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              At this point the band tried to shape their own style, getting inspiration by the drama of the bombastic classical 
              compositions like the ‘Dies Irae’ by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi and with the more modern theatrical rock 
              sound of Electric Light Orchestra, Supertramp and Klaatu. They went to the countryside of the city Poitiers in the 
              south of France, so the songs could be worked out in another environment. 
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Leaving France after seven productive writing days the band got back to 
              Belgium with several demo’s in their suitcases ready to record them.

          <div className='text-justify'>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Back in Belgium they were forced to record everything at home by themselves due to the lockdown at the time. 
              This created the opportunity to take the time to experiment a lot and create a studio album with detail. 
              They used a lot of piano and synthesizers, so it was a logical step to introduce Matthias Depraetere as 
              pianist to the band. When restrictions fell, they were able to invite some more friends to add instruments 
              like cello, violin, sax and trumpets, together with the dramatical composed choirs.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The person who completed the album was the producer, and our friend, Sergey Steenackers. 
              He really gave the album an extra boost and created a great listening experience with his magical mixing.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The album itself tells you the story about how a life can suddenly end and you realize that you haven’t done what your gut told you to do during your life. 
              You hear the whole concept as if it were a talk show that goes over the life of Krist Milkyway, the fictional main character of the album. 
              You can almost say that every song on the album is a memory of the character, or someone near to him. It Took A Lifetime was released on 16th of October 2021.
